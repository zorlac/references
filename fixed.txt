Remember in Phase 3, the runbook excluded it:
  /XF ntuser.dat ntuser.dat.log*
 
  But Windows needs NTUSER.DAT to load a profile. Without it, Windows says "this isn't a valid profile" and creates a TEMP profile.
 
  The Fix
 
  From LocalAdm_Strict, copy the registry hive files:
 
  copy "C:\Users\Z179535\NTUSER.DAT" "C:\Users\RTeston\"
  copy "C:\Users\Z179535\NTUSER.DAT.LOG*" "C:\Users\RTeston\"
 
  Also check if these exist and copy them too:
  copy "C:\Users\Z179535\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat" "C:\Users\RTeston\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\"
  copy "C:\Users\Z179535\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\UsrClass.dat.LOG*" "C:\Users\RTeston\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\"
 
  Why the Runbook Excluded It
 
  The runbook was cautious because NTUSER.DAT from a different user would cause problems. But in your case, you're using the same user (Z179535) - just relocating their profile folder. The
  NTUSER.DAT belongs to Z179535 and should work fine in the new location.
 
  After Copying
 
  1. Verify the files exist:
  dir "C:\Users\RTeston\NTUSER.DAT"
  2. Check registry again - make sure no new .bak appeared
  3. Try logging in as Z179535
